# Google IAM Custom Terraform Modules

This is a collection of resources that make it easier to non-destructively manage multiple IAM roles for resources on GCP

## Compatibility
This module is mant for use with Terraform 1.0+

## IAM Bindings
You can choose the following resource types to apply in the IAM bindings:

- Projects and external bindings (`projects` variable)
- Organizations(`organizations` variable)
- Folders (`folders` variable)
- Cloud Run Service (`cloud_run_service` variable)
- Compute Instance (`compute_instance_service` variable)
- Kms Crypto Keys (`kms_crypto_key` variable)
- Kms Key Rings (`kms_key_ring` variable)
- Secret Manager Secrets (`secret_manager_secret` variable)
- Storage buckets (`storage_bucket` variable)

Set the specified variable on the module call to choose the resources to affect.

### Permissions

In order to execute a submodule you must have a Service Account with an appropriate role to manage IAM for the applicable resource. The appropriate role differs depending on which resource you are targeting, as follows:

- Organization:
  - Organization Administrator: Access to administer all resources belonging to the organization
    and does not include privileges for billing or organization role administration.
  - Custom: Add resourcemanager.organizations.getIamPolicy and
    resourcemanager.organizations.setIamPolicy permissions.
- Project:
  - Owner: Full access and all permissions for all resources of the project.
  - Projects IAM Admin: allows users to administer IAM policies on projects.
  - Custom: Add resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy and resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy permissions.
- Folder:
  - The Folder Admin: All available folder permissions.
  - Folder IAM Admin: Allows users to administer IAM policies on folders.
  - Custom: Add resourcemanager.folders.getIamPolicy and
    resourcemanager.folders.setIamPolicy permissions (must be added in the organization).
- Storage bucket:
  - Storage Admin: Full control of GCS resources.
  - Storage Legacy Bucket Owner: Read and write access to existing
    buckets with object listing/creation/deletion.
  - Custom: Add storage.buckets.getIamPolicy	and
  storage.buckets.setIamPolicy permissions.
- Kms Key Ring:
  - Owner: Full access to all resources.
  - Cloud KMS Admin: Enables management of crypto resources.
  - Custom: Add cloudkms.keyRings.getIamPolicy and cloudkms.keyRings.getIamPolicy permissions.
- Kms Crypto Key:
  - Owner: Full access to all resources.
  - Cloud KMS Admin: Enables management of cryptoresources.
  - Custom: Add cloudkms.cryptoKeys.getIamPolicy	and cloudkms.cryptoKeys.setIamPolicy permissions.
- Secret Manager:
    - Secret Manager Admin: Full access to administer Secret Manager.
    - Custom: Add secretmanager.secrets.getIamPolicy and secretmanager.secrets.setIamPolicy permissions.
